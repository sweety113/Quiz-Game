# Quiz-Game
This Python program implements a simple quiz game that tests the user's knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts. The game consists of 5 multiple-choice questions, and the user's score is tracked throughout the game.

Features:
- 5 multiple-choice questions with answer options (A, B, C, D)
- User input is converted to uppercase for case-insensitive comparison
- Correct answers are tracked, and the user's score is displayed after each question
- Final score is displayed as a percentage at the end of the game

How it works:
1. The program prints a welcome message and displays the first question.
2. The user is presented with answer options and prompted to enter their choice.
3. The user's answer is checked against the correct answer using the check_answer function.
4. If the answer is correct, the user's score is incremented, and a success message is displayed.
5. If the answer is incorrect, a failure message is displayed, and the correct answer is shown.
6. Steps 2-5 are repeated for each question in the question_bank list.
7. After all questions have been answered, the final score is displayed as a percentage.
This code demonstrates basic Python concepts such as lists, dictionaries, functions, conditional statements, and loops.
